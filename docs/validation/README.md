# Validation Records

This directory stores dated evidence records for validation runs that affect Ethos product
claims or determinism boundaries.

Human-written validation records should avoid private usernames, hostnames, and one-off absolute
paths unless the path itself is the subject under test. Preserve commit ids, hashes, commands,
and pass/fail conclusions. Generated benchmark result files follow the evidence-handling policy
in `docs/public-release-checklist.md`.

Records:

- `claim-language-scan-2026-06-15.md` - current README/docs/examples/benchmark wording was
  scanned for unsupported public claims; README wording was narrowed to avoid speed,
  footprint, table, and heading overclaims.
- `ethos-bench-hygiene-2026-06-15.md` - sibling `ethos-bench` repo hygiene files were verified
  and its local unit/smoke checks passed.
- `license-notice-check-2026-06-15.md` - source license metadata, NOTICE boundaries, and
  ADR-0004 policy wiring were checked; release artifacts still need generated third-party
  license manifests and an executed `cargo-deny` policy check.
- `public-evidence-scan-2026-06-15.md` - tracked evidence and benchmark-result locations were
  scanned for private paths, hostnames, and generated Gate Zero output that belongs in
  `ethos-bench`.
- `rendered-crops-2026-06-14.md` - same-host rendered crop repeatability passed on macOS
  arm64 and Linux x64; cross-platform rendered crop byte identity failed because evidence
  bbox differed slightly across platforms.
- `trademark-screen-2026-06-15.md` - package registry reservations are complete for priority
  public surfaces, and manual review reported a clean `Ethos` trademark outcome for ADR-0006.
